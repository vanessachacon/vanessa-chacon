            Hello! I am Vanessa Chacon a native Oregonian. I am currently learning fullstack development but graduated with a
            bachelors in international development, a minor in Chicano Studies, and a minor in German. Prior to that,
            I served in the navy for five years,three of those years I was stationed in Japan. Throughout my life, I
            have traveled extensively and experienced quite a bit. I enjoy hiking, love animals, dancing, food, and
            trying new things. I find the world to be an extremely interesting place and enjoy learning.
